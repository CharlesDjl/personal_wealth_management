Based on the analysis of the codebase, here is the comprehensive status report and the required environment configuration.

### Project Status Analysis

The project is a **Personal Wealth Management System** with a clear separation between frontend and backend:

*   **Frontend**: Built with **React** (Vite), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It handles user interaction, asset visualization, and file uploads.
*   **Backend**: Built with **FastAPI** (Python). It manages business logic, connects to third-party services (market data, LLM), and interfaces with the database.
*   **Database & Auth**: **Supabase** is used for both data storage (PostgreSQL) and user authentication.
*   **External Services**:
    *   **Tushare**: For fetching real-time/historical financial market data (stocks, funds).
    *   **DashScope (Aliyun Qwen)**: For parsing asset screenshots using the Qwen-VL-Max multimodal model.

### Required Environment Variables (`.env`)

You need to configure the following environment variables in a `.env` file in the project root.

#### 1. Supabase Configuration (Required for Core Functionality)
Used for database connection and user authentication.
*   `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL (e.g., `https://xyz.supabase.co`).
*   `SUPABASE_KEY`: Your Supabase **Service Role Key** (preferred for backend) or Anon Key.
*   `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: Same as `SUPABASE_URL` (exposed to frontend).
*   `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase **Anon Key** (exposed to frontend).

#### 2. Tushare Configuration (Required for Market Data)
Used to fetch stock and fund prices.
*   `TUSHARE_TOKEN`: Your Tushare Pro API Token. (Obtain from [Tushare.pro](https://tushare.pro/)).

#### 3. DashScope Configuration (Required for "Import via Screenshot")
Used to parse screenshots of asset holdings using AI.
*   `DASHSCOPE_API_KEY`: Your Aliyun DashScope API Key (needs access to `qwen-vl-max`).

### Next Steps
1.  **Create `.env`**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if you haven't already (`cp .env.example .env`).
2.  **Fill Values**: Populate the `.env` file with your actual API keys.
3.  **Start Project**: Run `./start.sh` to initialize the environment and start services.
